=head1 NAME

Hadoop::Streaming::Reducer::Input - Parse input stream for reducer

=head1 VERSION

version 0.101860

=head1 METHODS

=head2 next_key 

    $Input->next_key();

Parses the next line into key/value (splits on tab) and returns the key portion.

Returns undef if there is no next line.

=head2 next_line

    $Input->next_line();

Reads the next line into buffer and returns it.

Returns undef if there are no more lines (end of file).

=head2 getline

    $Input->getline();

Returns the next available line. Clears the internal line buffer if set.

=head2 iterator

    $Input->iterator();

Returns a new Hadoop::Streaming::Reducer::Input::Iterator for this object.

=head2 each

    $Input->each();

Grabs the next line and splits on tabs.  Returns an array containing the output of the split.
