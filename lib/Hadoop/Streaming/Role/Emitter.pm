=head1 NAME

Hadoop::Streaming::Role::Emitter - Role to provide emit, counter, and status interaction with Hadoop::Streaming.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.110030

=head1 METHODS

=head2 emit

    $object->emit( $key, $value )

This method emits a key,value pair in the format expected by Hadoop::Streaming.
It does this by calling $self->put().  This catches errors from put and turns 
them into warnings.

=head2 put

    $object->put( $key, $value )

This method emits a key,value pair to STDOUT in the format expected by 
Hadoop::Streaming: ( key \t value \n )

=head2 counter

    $object->counter(
        group   => $group,
        counter => $countername,
        amount  => $count,
    );

This method emits a counter key to STDERR in the format expected by hadoop:
  reporter:counter:<group>,<counter>,<amount>

=head2 status

    $object->status( $message )

This method emits a status message to STDERR in the format expected by Hadoop::Streaming: 
  reporter:status:$message\n
